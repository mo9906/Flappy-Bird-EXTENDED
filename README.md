# Flappy-Bird-EXTENDED
Flappy Bird: EXTENDED is a feature-rich, modernized clone of the classic Flappy Bird game built in Python/PyQt5. It introduces Dynamic Random Events (like Moon Gravity and Cloudy Sky), a Pipe Control game mode, moving and special pipes, and a persistent local leaderboard, transforming the simple reflex game into a constantly evolving challenge.
